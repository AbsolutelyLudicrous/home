#important to remember:
#the webserver directory is also the home directory of the "webadmin" user
#so we ignore their dotfiles
\.*
#...except the gitignore
!\.gitignore
#(becuase I don't like rewriting the gitignore on every system)

#but make super sure to ignore webadmin's .gitconfig
.gitconfig

#we'll also ignore any directory called "private", which stores stuff like databases and logins
private
#also sometimes I end files with ".private", so let's ignore those too
*\.private
