An Orion-style spacecraft, an "Orion" for short, propels itself by detonating a series of nuclear bombs behind a massive pusher plate.
The energy imparted into the plate, which determines acceleration and plate wear, is a function of the standoff distance between bomb detonation and plate, and how the blast is "shaped".
Conventional nuclear bombs spew their energy in every direction, but more specialized nuclear pulse units, NPUs, can direct the explosion in the general direction of the pusher plate, a bit like a conventional shaped charge.

Fore of the plate, a series of shock absorbers turns the hammer-blow punch of nuclear fusion into a somewhat smoother series of waxing and waning accelerations.
Collectively, the pusher plate and the shock absorber series make up the "engine" of an Orion.
<br>
Even further forward is typically pulse unit storage, placed just fore of the engine.
This is done to simplify pulse unit delivery.

Foremost on the typical Orion is the payload, which can be anything which needs to be transported.
Common payloads include planetary landers and crew accomadations.
<hr>
Our example payload will be a Casaba Howitzer weapons system and a crew support system.
<hr>
Externally viewed, the payload is a hexagonal box stretching the length of a football pitch.
One end is a sharp point where the sides converge, the other is flat and merges with the propulsion assembly.
Out of the point, slightly off center, a domed cylinder emerges;
in battle the dome will shine a weak laser onto an enemy in order to guide the awesome nuclear flame of the Casaba Howitzer.
A series of shuttered dimples marr every other side of the hexagon.
<br>
From the dimples the Casaba Howitzer itself is deployed, a fearsome weapon consisting of a shaped nuclear charge propelling a beam of gigakelvin-heated tungsten in a narrow cone at over one million metres per second.
The searing lance of superheated tungsten penetrates a metre of aluminium at close ranges, and remains effective up to fifty thousand kilometres away.
The Casaba Howitzer can not be allowed to fire within a radius of the Orion proper, to do so would bathe the craft is contaminating radiation and induce neutron activation in the hull.
The Casaba Howitzer is instead accelerated outward at skew angles by the same series of explosions the Orion rides, this has the secondary effect of giving the Orion multiple firing angles on an enemy and of increasing the Orion's RADAR/LIDAR profile.
<br>
Internally viewed, most of the payload is Casaba Howitzer storage.
The guidance laser generator is buried through half the length of the payload.
Unpressurized areas not occupied by Casaba Howitzer tubes are occupied mostly by support systems, such as retractable radiators and fuel for the reaction control system.
<br>
The crew module is the point of the hexagon.
A small storm shelter sits just aft of the crew module proper, centered on the geometric center of the hexagon.
The point is split halfway down the middle; half can detach and deploy wing panels as a lifting body atmospheric entry vehicle.
A small propulsion system is attached to facilitate a subsonic landing on an atmospheric planet and a non-lithobraking landing on a non-atmospheric planet.
<hr>
All together, the Orion spans nearly two hundred metres and masses over ten thousand tons.
The Orion is truly a marvel of engineering, its engine striking the balance between effeciency and acceleration, its payload having a high mass fraction, and its ease of construction making the concept readily accesible.
