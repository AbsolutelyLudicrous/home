I lied, this isn't about systemd sucking.
<br>
This is about a girl I know and love.
<hr>
Let's call her N.
There's a lot you need to know about N to know why I love her.
<br>
I guess first you should know how I love her, for one thing.
It's not a romatic attraction, it's more like we're family.
Even though we have no blood relation, we're like sisters.
Truthfully, somewhat tragically, I <i>am</i> closer to her than I am to my blood family.
I'd trust her with my life.
<hr>
N's a trans lesbian little who's pulling off awesome stuff.
<br>
(I can't really give too many details about her, she's a bit of a unique person, and could probably be tracked down easily.)
<hr>
But what's she got to do with me?
<br>
Thing about N is that she's helped me accept a lot about myself.
<hr>
Trans, first of all.
She was the first person I came out to.
For a while, she was the only person I was out to.*
I still remember that night, it was probably the longest half-hour of my life.
<br>
We talked a bunch.
We started to text.
Sometimes about trans stuff, many times not.
It was those times talking about trans stuff that helped me a lot.
Because for a while I didn't feel valid at all, self doubt was killing me.
We talked about shared experiences.
She pointed out some insanities in my invalidity.
She helped me realize that there is no such thing as invalid identities, that you can just identify as whatever and it's fine.
She accepted me, and helped me, in a time when I thought that no-one would.
<br>
For that I owe her my life.
<br>
<br>
And I guess also, she provides a role model for me.
She'd be horrified to hear that, I've told her as much and gotten a confused reaction.
But she does.
A person who's awesome and just so happens to be trans, that's goals right there.
<br>
<br>
And she's a lesbian, too.
She helped me see that, not only is it okay to be trans, it's also okay to be gay&trans.
For some reason I couldn't easily see that at the time.
<br>
Look, I'm kinda thick, okay?
<br>
<br>
But yeah, we got to talking about that too.
Combined with the transy talk, I really think I got to accepting myself much sooner than I would have otherwise.
<br>
<br>
* I did come out to my mother a few weeks after N, but somehow failed and wound up having to do it a second, and then a third, time a few months later.
<hr>
And you know what, her littleness has kinda helped me too.
<br>
I'm not a little myself, I don't think so anyways, but it just further destroyed my notions that to be awesome you had to be completely """normal""".
I thought that to be cool, you had to be a cishet super masc jock who knows everything and takes everything super seriously always.
<br>
Boy, was I sure wrong.
<hr>
There's probably some more misconceptions she's destroyed that I just can't think right now.
There's definitely more ways she's helped me.
<br>
<br>
She's saved my life, for one thing.
It's a dark tale, it involves suicide, I won't talk about it today.
<br>
I guess that, when I say that I owe her my life, I mean it kinda literally; huh.
<hr>
So yeah, that's N.
<br>
I have more to talk about her, but it's late here and I need sleep.
<br>
<br>
Just, I love her.
