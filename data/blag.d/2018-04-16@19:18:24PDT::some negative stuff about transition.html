<i>this is probably going to be pretty negative but whatever, you have been warned</i>
<hr>
I'm mad.
<br>
I'm mad at the passage of time.
I'm mad at typical male human development.
I'm mad at my dumb ass.
<br>
I'm mad.
<br>
I'm mad because I didn't start transitioning sooner.
<hr>
Just one year ago, I could not grow a beard.
I could get a few scraggly hairs and that was it.
Believe me, I tried.
I was able to dry-shave.
<br>
I'm currently looking for laser hair removal places.
<hr>
I need to contact about ten different groups, agencies, corporations, about getting my name fixed.
<br>
Of them, only three even knew I existed a year ago.
<hr>
I grew too many inches over the last year.
I tower over cis girls.
I am larger than I should be.
<hr>
You get the idea.
<br>
I'm mad at everything because I feel like transitioning even just a year earlier would do wonders for me.
I could have had so much more, had I just gotten things out of the way last year.
<br>
I'll never have that life that could have been, and quite frankly that doesn't feel fair.
