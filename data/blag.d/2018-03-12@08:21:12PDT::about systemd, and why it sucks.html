<h1>systemd is an init system</h1>
<h1>init is pid 1</h1>
<hr>
If you don't know or care to know what that means, this is not the blag post for you.
<hr>
An init is the program loaded which launches all other programs.
The login manager is started by init, the desktop server is started by init, the date/time daemon is started by init, the cron scheduling daemon is started by init, <i>anything which starts when you power on your computer is started by init</i>.
Traditionally, init only manages these low-level system programs, called daemons or services.
init also manages which daemons run at startup and can start and stop daemons at runtime.
<br>
Example invocations of init control, in this case using FreeBSD's `service`, are as such:
<br>
<pre>
	root@freebsd:~ # echo "ntpd_enabled=\"YES\"" >> /etc/rc.conf	#enable the NTP daemon by appending a line to rc.conf
	root@freebsd:~ # service ntpd start				#starts the NTP, Network Time Protocol, daemon if enabled in /etc/rc.conf
	root@freebsd:~ # service ntpd onestart				#starts the NTP daemon even if not enabled
	root@freebsd:~ # service ntpd stop				#stop the NTP daemon if started
	tree@freebsd:~ $ service -l					#list all services/daemons, note that this can be done without root privelages
</pre>
Or, by using systemd:
<pre>
	root@distro:~ # systemctl enable ntpd		#enable the NTP daemon
	root@distro:~ # systemctl start ntpd		#start the NTP daemon, even if not enabled at startup
	root@distro:~ # systemctl stop ntpd		#stop the NTP daemon
	tree@distro:~ $ systemctl list-unit-files	#list all available services and status, again does not require root
</pre>

No far, nothing bad, right?
Sure, the syntax is a bit different, but that's not a bad thing.
<br>
The problem is that systemd does so much more than init.
Searching every process on my Solus system returned the following:
<pre>

There's a PID 1 in there, no problem with that, but what are these other processes systemd is running?
<br>
systemd is PID 1, and some other stuff.
systemd handles, among other things:
system logging, monitoring daemons;
device node management, ensuring that the system can see things plugged into it, see `man hier | grep -B 2 -A 32 -ie "/dev" | less` for more;
time syncronization, making sure that the system's time is correct;
logging in, including seizing control of TTYs;
and domain name resolution, making sure that IP addresses on the local network get turned into hostnames.
<br>
And holy shit is that a fuckton.
What the hell do you mean, my init has taken over some kernel-level functions and can perform networking on its own!?
<br>
Traditionally, each of those tasks would be left to an individual program.
System logging would be managed be the daemon itself,
devices nodes would be handled by (e)udev or hal or anything but init,
time is handled by NTPD,
logins are handled by the `login` program and TTYs are handled by the kernel,
domain names and networking are handled by BIND or unbound and wpa_supplicant.
<hr>
<h2>So what the heck is init, the program which is solely responsible for starting a few daemons and then fucking off, doing managing all that?</h2>
(The answer: scope creep.)
<br>
Now I hear you thinking, "So what if it handles a lot?, why's that my problem?"
<br>
It's a problem because having one thing handle a bunch of different tasks is setting yourself up for failure.
In systemd, if the time sync daemon has a flaw then so does the TTY layer, and the login manager, and the device node manager.
Each part is largely unrelated to the others, but will get borked all the same.
And that sucks.
<br>
This isn't purely hypothetical, either, take the time that <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14682210">systemd had a bug which gave users who started their names with digits root access</a>.
<br>
Think on that.
A flaw in init crtically compromised millions of computers.
<h3>What the fuck?</h3>
And the problem doesn't stop there, Lennart Poettering, the lead developer, dismissed the problem, because another """feature""" of systemd is that names should't start with numbers.
Problem solved, right?
But then you have to wonder,
<h3>Why does init get to decide what names are valid?</h3>
Because seriously, what the fuck?
This screws over legacy systems, for one thing, and for another thing it disallows users to use arbitrary characters in their names as may be desired by non-English users, but mostly <b>it's out of the scope of init</b>.
<hr>
Troublingly, it also tells us that the mindset of systemd is "Our way or the highway".
<br>
init is PID 1, PID 1 is init.
Once init creeps beyond PID 1, it becomes nigh impossible to switch software.
So much stuff depends on systemd that it becomes a herculean feat to move away from it.
Even systemd-free operating systemds, such as Artix Linux, often have to ship a "dummy" version of systemd to make programs compiled against systemd happy.
<br>
And, as we learned from Poettering's response to the digit-leading-name fiasco, the developers believe that they are more knowledgable than us users and will force us to use a workflow that they have deemed to be """best""".
systemd will force you into a certain workflow, even if your use case could be better served by doing something else.
And you know what?
<br>
<b>Fuck that.</b>
<br>
<h3>It is the very spirit of Unix to be able to tweak your system to your use case.</h3>
To force users into one workflow, to have one program manage several system-critical functions, to override parts of the kernel, is anti-Unix.
systemd is anti-Unix.
systemd robs you of choice.
