I'm a nerd.
That's most of it, really.
Oh yeah I'm also trans.
I'm not sure if this will turn out to be a more nerdy or a more transy blog.
Looking at Mastodon tells me that it'll be a nerdy blog, but also most of my nerd toots are just short thoughts about why technology is both the best and the worst thing to happen to humanity.
<br><br>
&nbsp;
I don't plan on using this blog to talk about short things,
I plan on using it to talk about long and complicated stuff.
<br><hr>
&nbsp;
Let's talk about me being trans, first of all.
That's somehow the shorter one.
<br><br>
&nbsp;
The TL;DR is that gender is a fuck.
I use they/them and she/her pronouns.
I'm definitely some kind of nonbinary.
Thing is that sometimes I feel more binary trans, some days I desperately want to be a woman.
Most days I'm just kinda "meh" on the whole subject, though.
So yeah, I guess maybe I'm genderfluid transfem?
I pretty much just call myself flat nonbinary, though.
<br><br>
&nbsp;
There's a complicating factor there.
Recently I've been thinking that maybe I somehow talked myself into the nonbinary label through some internalized transphobia,
that maybe I couldn't accept myself as a binary trans woman and so chose the middle ground.
So that's complicated.
<br><br>
&nbsp;
I've been thinking on that, and have basically just made an agreement with myself to do whatever makes me happiest.
If that involves being a binary trans woman, then cool; if that involves being my screwy nonbinary self, cool.
<br><br>
&nbsp;
Gender is hard, yo.
<br><hr>
&nbsp;
Let's talk about something easier, like the entire field of computer science.
<br><br>
&nbsp;
I love computers.
I am a hardcore Unix systems nerd.
I love everything from the hardware to the user.
I get deep into the intricacies of what makes machines tick.
I even have a favorite instruction set architecture!
<br>
&nbsp;
(It's RISC-V, if you couldn't have guessed that.)
<br><br>
&nbsp;
Hell, let's do that.
Let's talk about my software stack and why I use it.
<br><br>
&nbsp;
I use GNU/Linux and FreeBSD.
I'm going to call GNU/Linux Linux, but I do recognize and understand that Linux is merely the kernel of all Linux-based operating systems.
I run Linuxes on most of my laptops, and FreeBSD on my servers.
<br><br>
&nbsp;
I run Solus on an Asus K501UW laptop which acts as my high-resource computing box.
That machine has entirely stock hardware, largely because the only upgradable thing on it is the RAM.
I don't like that machine very much, weirdly enough;
It's tough to modify and is pretty fragile.
<br>
&nbsp;
Why Solus?
It's rolling, stable, and easy to use; the holy grail on a home Linux system.
I ran Arch for a while, but I got tired of fixing nvidia's bullhockey every few weeks.
I tried to run FreeBSD on it, but couldn't get the graphics drivers to work with my nvidia card, and the integrated Intel GPU is only in FreeBSD 12.
It can't run FreeBSD 12 yet, it kernel panics every few minutes.
I gave Debian a try, but had troubles with apt being finnicky and I don't like the thought of having three package managers for one system.
RHEL-based and Ubuntu-based distros feel bloated and corporate, without much room for customization.
I would use Artix on it, because Artix is rolling, stable, and systemd-free, but I've had troubles getting some things like printers to work on Artix.
Also, using an Arch-based distro with an nvidia card is just asking for xorg to break.
<br><br>
&nbsp;
I run Artix on another laptop, an HP Compaq Presario CQ56.
I plopped some extra RAM in this one and replaced the CD drive with another hard drive.
I'm happy enough with the hardware it has, it's good enough for web browsing.
<br>
&nbsp;
I run more than Artix on it, I have a FreeBSD live USB plugged into the side and allocated some space on the second hard drive to elementaryOS.
FreeBSD is for fiddling around, elementaryOS is for rescuing Artix when it breaks.
I've never had Artix break, and I'm hoping that it never will, but I still want to play it safe and keep a small rescue distro handy.
<br><br>
&nbsp;
I can complain about the Compaq, too.
It sucks.
Battery life is limited to 4hrs, even with an extended battery.
It only has three USB ports.
It runs at a minimum of 60*C.
The screen has a bad resolution.
The network card in it has a terrible range.
And, most of all, HP's BIOS restricts what hardware you can use.
<br><br>
&nbsp;
I have another laptop.
An ancient MSI U100 WiND.
Oddly enough, I have no complaints about this machine.
It runs FreeBSD and it does it well.
It even has a compatible graphics card.
I can squeeze six hours of constant use out of the battery.
It's small enough to carry comfortably.
<br>
&nbsp;
The only reason I don't use it as my daily driver is that it's old, and has old hardware.
The CPU runs at just 1.6Ghz, which is just enough for a few browser tabs.
<br>
&nbsp;
I kinda like the CPU, though.
It's old enough where it was the last generation of Intel CPU to lack the Intel Management Engine, which is a thing that I hate with a burning passion.
<br>
&nbsp;
Why FreeBSD?
Part of it is security.
I threw GELI on it during the install, which means a hypothetical attacker with physical access would need to use a FreeBSD live stick instead of a Linux live stick.
It just means that gaining access to my data would be a bit more of a pain.
The other part of it is that I like FreeBSD.
It's rock-solid, systemd-free, and fairly easy to use.
There isn't a GUI for many things, I'm comfortable enough in a command line where I don't mind.
I enjoy the OS being entirely systemd-free because I don't like systemd, I view it as bloated and stupid.
I also don't have to worry about doing full-system upgrades, I know that any bugs will have been worked out by the FreeBSD team.
I've never had something break on FreeBSD, once a system is configured it runs without errors.
<br><br>
&nbsp;
Somebody remind me to talk about why systemd sucks in another blog post.
<br><br>
&nbsp;
My other machines are all servers, I don't really have a proper workstation in the traditional sense.
<br>
&nbsp;
I have an RPi3B running FreeBSD 12 which serves as my big data storage NAS.
Or at least, it will.
&nbsp;
I'm currently working on moving some data between disks, and need to wait on that to finish before configuring NAS services.
But yeah, it has a little over ten terabytes of storage attached to it.
I'm not worrying about running out of storage any time soon.
<br>
&nbsp;
My other home server, one that I have physical access to, is a 2011 iMac running FreeBSD 11.
It runs well.
It handles most of my x86_64 needs.
There's some stuff I would do on the RPi3B, but stuff like Python3 and Go don't like the aarch64 instruction set.
<br><hr>
It's been more than an hour since I've started this blog post, I think I'll tie things up there.
In the next one I should talk about why I use ZSH and NeoViM.
<br><hr>
It feels kinda good to just drop this stuff out into the public.
