<h3>Author's notes:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I wrote this for a friend.
	I was writing, well, you'll see, but it involves NUKES! and stuff, just before this.
	Also I may or may not have been listening to heavy metal while writing this.
	(But honestly these days when am I not listening to heavy metal?)
	</li>
	<li>The original was sent over SMS, and was the ending of a conversation.
	</li>
	<li>I took the start of the story from <a href="http://shortstoriesshort.com/story/the-swan-and-the-owl/">here</a>, but figured that a bedtime story to a friend shouldn't involve death and a message about never leaving your friends.
	I had to think of a better ending once I saw the moral of the source material, see if you can spot the "Oh crap!" moment.
	</li>
	<li>Also, I had to search what swans ate.
	Turns out that swans are vegetarians who sometimes eat bugs.
	</li>
	<li>I wasn't sure how to gender the birds.
	I stuck with just using "the owl"/"the swan" for a while, but that got clunky.
	So I decided to make them lesbians.
	Suck my girldick, heteros.

Anyways, without further ado,
<h2>The story of the swan and the owl who loved each other very much</h2>

<blockquote><h3><i>&nbsp;I have a story about two birds, a swan and an owl.</i></h3>
There was once a swan, who lived near a lake in a forest.
<br>
One night, an owl spotted the swan while out hunting.
<br>
The owl saw the swan, and took a liking to the swan.
<br>
They became friends, they met for many days at the swan's lake.
<br>
Eventually, the owl and the swan discovered that there was only so much you could do on a lake, and grew bored.
<br>
The owl invited the swan back to the owl's tree hole, where the owl spent most of the owl's daylight hours.
<br>
The owl and the swan found that they loved each other, and so decided to cohabitate.
<br>
The owl moved the owl's nest to a nice tree hole near the swan's lake.
<br>
The tricky thing about owls and swans is that owls sleep during the day, and swans sleep during the night.
<br>
They interacted during the liminal hours, twilight and early morn.
<br>
And when they did, the owl would always tell great tales of the mice she had hunted and the things she had seen while cruising high above the forest.
<br>
And the swan would always speak of the gorgeous animals which had stopped by the lake to drink, and how the local fish population is doing.
<br>
She, the swan, would make nice salads for the owl, and the owl would bring tender meats for the swan.
<br>
In this way, they managed to eat breakfast and dinner together.
<br>
They did this every day until they grew so old that they could not stay awake to meet each other!
<br>
And when that happened, one would always stand guard near the other; the swan would watch over the sleeping owl and the owl would watch over the sleeping swan.
<br>
And they would always leave food for each other, giving the other a kind of breakfast in bed.
<br>
And as the swan sleeps now with the owl watching over her, so too should you, <i>name</i>.
