If you haven't caught on by now, I'm not straight.
<hr>
...and that's about as specific as I can really get.
My sexuality is weird and finnicky and inconsistent.

I have a sex drive, I just don't like it very much.
I sometimes desire sex, but I don't like the fact that I do.
It often feels somehow wrong to be aroused.

I'm not sure how much of that is some weird social conditioning.

I just don't label myself, because it's hard, yo.
