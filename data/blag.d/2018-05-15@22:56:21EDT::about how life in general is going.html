Life's good, yo.
<br>
Currently, I'm late and it's a bit sleepy, but I feel like I should give a bit of a general life update.
Plus I'm waiting for a tarball to download, and can't sleep this machine until that's done.

I got my name legally changed, finally.
I have a boyfriend now, my first romantic relationship.
I'm doing loads more cool computer stuff, I'm switching from Solus to Gentoo and have done some pretty hardcore hardware hackery.
<br>
Life's good.

The name change was fairly simple, legally.
Most trouble came from family, the legal process itself consisted of about a half hour of paperwork and then a half hour court date.
Whole thing cost about $100.
<br>
My personal advice is to do it sooner rather than later, I had about two months between filing the initial paperwork and my court date.
It's not unheard of for the delay to be even longer.

My boyfriend.
Gosh I could gush about him for hours.
I won't, to preserve anonyminity.
<br>
He's trans too, too.

I'm dabbling with Gentoo now.
I've had a few bootable installs, but just recently had to nuke an otherwise good install because of issues with firmware not loading.
My current install is minimal, with just the base system, some low-level utilities, and NeoViM installed.
It boots, but I'm dumb and forgot to put a root password on it, and so haven't done anything without the magic of "chroot" yet.
<br>
I recently set up NFS to share my media read-only across the network, and have been taking advantage of that.
It was surprisingly simple to set up, just making /srv/${media} globally accessible read-only.
I have not yet done anything fancy with authenticating requests or rw-access, that's a weekend project.
<br>
More on the topic of mounting, I set up my (GPG'ed) keys on an SD card and have an entry in fstab to mount, then bind-mount, my key directories.
The SD card becomes essential to opening any online account I have.
I now have a physical key to my online identity, and I think that's kinda neat.
<br>
On the hardware side of things, I got a drive caddy to replace my T430's CD bay.
I nicked 250GB of spinning rust out of a different machine, and am currently scheming about using it for nightly backups of the root partition.
Initially, I was going to use it with a SATA->2*mSATA adapter for a RAID1 of my home partition and to re-insert the WWAN card that came with the T430, but the adapter I bought was upside-down, so I went with a more vanilla solution.

So yeah, life's going well for me.
