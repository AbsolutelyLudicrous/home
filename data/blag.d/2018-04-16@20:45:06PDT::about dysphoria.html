It ain't fun.
<br>
I just feel gross.
Hideous.
Massive and masculine.
<br>
I just want to be a small cute girl.
<br>
Trouble is that I've got the body of a crusty nerd boy.
<br>
This discrepancy causes me a lot of distress.
<hr>
I can not stand living in this body.
I will not live in this body.
<br>
The phrase "do or die" has been in my mind a lot.
<br>
And that's what keeps me going most days:
the thought that, one day soon, I won't have to live in this horrific flesh sack.
One way or the other.
<br>
I should be going on HRT soon.
I need to.
<br>
I <b>am</b> going on HRT within a year.
<hr>
My fear with HRT is that it won't be enough.
That too many years of running on T have ruined my body.
<br>
E won't reverse my body hair growth or shrink my height or feminize my voice.
I feel vaguely fucked, like no matter what I do it won't be enough.
<hr>
I have cried once in the past five years.
It was the day I quite literally had my coming-out beaten out of me.
<br>
I want to be able to cry again.
I have been so terribly disconnected from the world, and it's awful.
Every time I start to feel something strong, some force just pushes it down and represses it.
I hate it.
