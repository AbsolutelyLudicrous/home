<h1>systemd is an init system</h1>

<hr>
If you don't know or care to know what that means, this is not the blag post for you.
<hr>
An init is the program loaded which launches all other programs.
The login manager is started by init, the desktop server is started by init, the date/time daemon is started by init, the cron scheduling daemon is started by init, <i>anything which starts when you power on your computer is started by init</i>.
Traditionally, init only manages these low-level system programs, called daemons or services.
init also manages which daemons run at startup and can start and stop daemons at runtime.
<br>
Example invocations of init control, in this case using FreeBSD's `service`, are as such:
<br>
<pre>
        root@freebsd:~ # echo "ntpd_enabled=\"YES\"" >> /etc/rc.conf    #enable the NTP daemon by appending a line to rc.conf
        root@freebsd:~ # service ntpd start                             #starts the NTP, Network Time Protocol, daemon if enabled in /etc/rc.conf
        root@freebsd:~ # service ntpd onestart                          #starts the NTP daemon even if not enabled
        root@freebsd:~ # service ntpd stop                              #stop the NTP daemon if started
        tree@freebsd:~ $ service -l                                     #list all services/daemons, note that this can be done without root privelages
</pre>
Or, by using systemd:
<pre>
        root@distro:~ # systemctl enable ntpd           #enable the NTP daemon
        root@distro:~ # systemctl start ntpd            #start the NTP daemon, even if not enabled at startup
        root@distro:~ # systemctl stop ntpd             #stop the NTP daemon
        tree@distro:~ $ systemctl list-unit-files       #list all available services and status, again does not require root
</pre>
<br>
Nifty, right?
<hr>
But systemd does so much more for you.
systemd automatically handles system logging, device node management, time syncronization, user logins, event scheduling, and local domain resolution.
systemd abstracts away from the distro maintainers many low-level and unstable functions, leaving the maintainers more time to do important OS maintenance and development.
Things the developers don't have to worry about don't cause problems for the developers, and it's important to have happy devs.
<hr>
Happy devs write more code and write better code.
<br>
Love your devs, make them happy.
Don't give them more work to do.
<br>
Accept the monolithic systemd into your distro.
<hr>
<h3>Use systemd, love your devs</h3>
